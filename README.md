# API-Weather-Forecast-Predictor
This project uses Python and user input of a zip code or city and state name to tell you the weather conditions using an API call from OpenWeatherMap. The weather conditions include temperature, temp high, temp low, pressure, humidity, and cloud conditions. Once the weather conditions are shown, the user will be asked if they would like to enter another zip code or city/state name.
